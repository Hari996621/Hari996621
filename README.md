## About Me

I am a web developer with 2 years of experience specializing in front-end development with React.js and back-end development with Node.js. I have hands-on experience in creating optimized SQL queries, error handling, and maintaining AWS resources. I also have a strong background in working with databases like MongoDB and implementing real-time data streaming with Kafka.

## Projects

### Grocery Online Shopping App

A robust online shopping platform where users can browse and purchase groceries. Initially developed as a monolithic application, it has been refactored to a microservices architecture using Node.js, ES6, and RESTful APIs to ensure scalability and maintainability.

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, SQL
- **Architecture**: Microservices
- **Deployment**: AWS
